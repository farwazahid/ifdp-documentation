The project investigates whether a centralized, partially verified directory can improve transparency and efficiency in connecting startups, founders, and investors in early-stage ecosystem.


# Investor–Founder Discovery Platform (IFDP)

**Role**: Product & Research Analyst | **Organization**: Invest2Innovate (i2i)  
**Timeline**: March 2024 – June 2025 | **Stage**: Pilot → Launch → Iteration

## 🧠 Abstract  

The Investor–Founder Discovery Platform (IFDP) was developed to address inefficiencies in Pakistan’s startup ecosystem, where founders face difficulty accessing aligned investors and investors lack a transparent, verified channel to discover investable startups. This project aimed to design, build, and evaluate a centralized platform with verification mechanisms and public access. Over 15 months, the project combined iterative prototyping, focus group studies, verification model design, and structured tracking of adoption metrics. The platform successfully onboarded 500+ profiles per category (startups, founders, investors), exceeding targets in two categories, and contributed to policy and ecosystem discussions nationally and internationally.

## 🚨 Research Problem  

Founders in Pakistan struggle to connect with relevant investors due to fragmented, outdated, or closed networks. Similarly, investors lack a transparent way to discover credible founders or startups.  

**Hypothesis**: A public discovery platform with verified directories and clear trust signals would improve outreach efficiency and bridge this matchmaking gap.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Launch a pilot platform with searchable directories for startups, founders, and investors.  
- Develop and implement a verification model (tick mark for verified, disclaimer for unverified).  
- Onboard 500+ profiles per category with minimum 100 verified per group by June 2025.  
- Collect and analyze quantitative (onboarding data, verification rates) and qualitative (focus group feedback) insights.  
- Disseminate findings through launch events, ecosystem reports, and quarterly newsletters.  

---

## 👩‍💻 Role & Contributions  

- **Discovery & Research**: Conducted focus groups and interviews with founders and ecosystem stakeholders.  
- **Platform Execution**: Built pilot version using **Softr**, migrated to **WordPress** after early testing.  
- **Verification Logic**: Designed tick-based trust model and disclaimers; established verification criteria.  
- **Evaluation & Iteration**: Tracked onboarding metrics, analyzed feedback, and updated UI/UX accordingly.  
- **Dissemination**: Coordinated launch events, reported findings in i2i’s *Quarterly Funding Reports* and *Monthly Newsletters*.
